## About Me

I am Nikhil Kumar Korrapati, a data engineer by trade and a business analytics leader in the making. I build and orchestrate modern data stacks with Snowflake, Azure Data Factory, and Apache Airflow, and I am pursuing a part-time Master’s in Business Analytics and AI to expand my impact from pipelines to boardroom insights. My portfolio captures the experiments, assignments, and narrative visualizations that trace this transition.

## Spotlight Visualizations

| Project | Medium | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minard's Napoleon March | Jupyter Notebook | Reimagined the classic 1861 flow map with modern Python tooling, layering troop strength, temperature, and geography into a single cohesive story. [[View]](Assignments/Minard/Minard.ipynb) |


## Coursework Gallery

### 1. Resurrecting Minard’s Masterpiece
- Medium: Python, Pandas, Altair, Jupyter
- Focus: Spatial-temporal storytelling, design benchmarking, reproducibility
- Takeaway: Learned to structure notebooks so each chart builds context for the next, enabling readers to follow both code and narrative.



## Visual Storylines I Love to Build

- Decision-ready dashboards that blend trend cards, anomaly callouts, and what-if toggles for leadership forums.
- Narrative scrollytelling pieces that walk readers from context to insight to action on a single page.
- Comparative visuals that unpack how policy, process, or product changes ripple through customer behavior and operations.
